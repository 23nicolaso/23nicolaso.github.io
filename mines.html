    <h3>Mines Project</h3>

  <p>
    When development on this area began, average playtime per session was low, so players rarely met or interacted in the lobby.
    To address this, I proposed and built the <em>Mines </em>â€” a challenging, repeatable activity players can do while waiting.
  </p>

  <p>
    I developed the Mines solo, covering level design, 3D modeling, texturing, sound design, and animations. The feature now includes
    monsters, mineable ores that award in-game currency, and procedurally generated cave systems polished in Blender.
  </p>
<br>
  <h4>Key Challenges & Solutions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      
      <strong>Procedural cave generation:</strong> 3D, low-poly cave generation has fewer established approaches than 2D.
      I combined a cellular automata generator with flood-fill region filtering and leveraged Blender modifiers to achieve performant,
      natural cave geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Core PvE systems:</strong> I balanced rapid iteration for weekly patches with building new mine levels and
      creating monsters, ensuring combat and progression felt cohesive and shippable each week.
    </li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <p>
    <strong>Impact:</strong> Average playtime per player more than doubled, even as the community scaled rapidly.
